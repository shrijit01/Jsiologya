//		The space complexity for merge sort is :
		
		
		//Explanation
		
//		To check the space complexity of the merge sort algorithm, 
//		you need to identify the amount of extra memory used by 
//		the algorithm during its execution.
//
//		Identify the extra memory used: In merge sort, the algorithm
//		creates a temporary array of the same size as the input array
//		to store the sorted elements. This temporary array is used for
//		merging the subarrays during the sorting process.
//
//		Determine the input size: The input size is the number 
//		of elements in the array that needs to be sorted.
//
//		Analyze the algorithm: The algorithm creates a temporary
//		array of the same size as the input array, which is used for
//		merging the subarrays during the sorting process. Therefore,
//		the space complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n) 
//		where n is the input size. This is because the space 
//		used by the algorithm is directly proportional to the input size.
//
//		It's worth noting that, merge sort is considered as an in
//		-place sorting algorithm, as the only extra space it requires
//		is the space needed to hold the temporary array to merge the 
//		subarrays, which is equal to the size of the input array. So
//		the space complexity is O(n) and it is not considered as a space-efficient sorting algorithm.
//
//		Also, note that, if you have a sort algorithm that creates a 
//		new array and copies the elements from the original array, it 
//		is not considered as in-place algorithm and the space complexity
//		would be O(n) in addition to the original array.

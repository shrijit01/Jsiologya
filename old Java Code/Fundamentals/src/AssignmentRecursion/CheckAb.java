//
//		If the first character of the string is not 'a' the function 
//	will return false as the string should start with an 'a'
//		if (input.charAt(0) != 'a') { return false;}
//
//		If the string has at least 2 characters and the first two characters are
//	"bb", the function will make a recursive call to the rest of the string after 
//	removing the first 2 characters and return the result of this call, this is 
//			done according to rule c.

//	I was able to think about the solution for this problem by breaking it down into smaller steps and understanding the rules that the string needs to follow.
//
//	First, I read through the problem statement and understood that the string should start with an 'a' and it should contain only 'a's and 'b's.
//	I then identified the rules that the string needs to follow: Each 'a' is followed by nothing or an 'a' or "bb" and Each "bb" is followed by nothing or an 'a".
//	I realized that the problem can be solved using recursion, where the function starts with the first character of the string and checks if it follows the rules.
//	I wrote the initial version of the code, which only checks for two cases: if the first two characters are "bb" and if the first character is 'a' and the rest of the string is checked.
//	I realized that this is not enough to cover all the possible cases, so I added two more cases: check if the first character is 'a' and the second character is 'a' or not and check if the first character is 'a' and the next two characters are "bb" or not.
//	Finally, I tested the function with different inputs to make sure it's working correctly.
//	It's also worth mentioning that I've used the knowledge of the substring method in Java, which allows me to extract a portion of a string, which is useful in this problem.
